naturally?\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,090\r\nAnd I think the first reason for this\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,040\r\nis that we are actually animals, really.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,060\r\nWe still are animals,\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,050\r\nand we have fight or flight built into us.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,060\r\nAnd what happens in a stressful situation\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,030\r\nis that chemicals like adrenaline\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,080\r\npump into our bloodstream,\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,020\r\nand the objective of those chemicals\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,040\r\nis to help us run away or put up a stronger fight.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,080\r\nBut running away and fighting harder\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,000\r\nare not really appropriate\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,010\r\nresponses to most work situations.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,050\r\nNow animals only have these two choices: fight or flight.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,000\r\nBut we have third one,\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,030\r\nwhich is to talk calmly about an outcome\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,050\r\nthat can work for both parties.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,000\r\nAnd this is really the essence of assertiveness.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,040\r\nNot being aggressive.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,070\r\nNot being too submissive.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,020\r\nBut calmly working out an acceptable outcome for all.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,030\r\nI\'ll give you an example of how easy it is\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,050\r\nto get into a fight or flight situation,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,090\r\nand also how ineffective it is.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,020\r\nI was going on a cycle ride.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,000\r\nIt was about 20 miles.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040\r\nAnd after the first mile, we went past a house.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,010\r\nAnd this German Shepherd Alsatian dog\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010\r\ncame rushing out barking at me.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,050\r\nIt gave me a real shock, and I quickly cycled away.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,060\r\nAnd I went into flight mode.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,070\r\nThe adrenaline pumped in.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,070\r\nI cycled away.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,010\r\nI was faster than the dog.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,040\r\nAnd I got away.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040\r\nAnd I was thinking about it as I cycled around.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,030\r\nAnd I was thinking,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,030\r\nThat dog, I\'m gonna get him.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,030\r\nBecause I knew that at the end of the ride,\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,080\r\nwe were going to go back past the same house.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040\r\nAnd I spent the whole 20 miles thinking about this dog.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,010\r\nI\'m gonna reach down and I\'m gonna get my bike pump.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,020\r\nI\'m gonna jump off my bike, and I\'m gonna shout at the dog.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,050\r\nAnd as we approached the house, I did just that.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,040\r\nI was reaching down.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,070\r\nI had the bike pump ready.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,000\r\nI was all ready to get him.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,050\r\nAnd of course he didn\'t come out.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,040\r\nHe was asleep or something like that.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,050\r\nAnd I\'d wasted the whole bike ride\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,070\r\nbeing angry, ready for this dog.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,080\r\nAnd I never got closure.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040\r\nEven now, I\'m kind of thinking about it.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nI never got closure.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nI never got a chance to have a go at the dog.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,030\r\nAnd what I should have done was let it go,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,010\r\nbut it\'s hard to do because you\'ve got these chemicals\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,070\r\ngoing through your bloodstream.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,010\r\nSo the moral of this story I think is\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,050\r\nthat with an animal there\'s no other option.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,000\r\nIt\'s either dominate or be dominated.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,040\r\nBut if it was a person,\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,010\r\nthe third option would have been much better.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,000\r\nNow another reason why it\'s not automatic\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,050\r\nto be assertive is our upbringing.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,050\r\nSchool is pretty much a jungle.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,090\r\nIt\'s pretty much a fight or flight jungle.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,000\r\nKids haven\'t learned about assertiveness yet.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,090\r\nThey\'re still animals in this sense.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,060\r\nAnd kids understand this.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,080\r\nI can remember at school there was one of my classmates\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,090\r\nwho was terrified of wasps.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,020\r\nAnd guess what happened?\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,080\r\nEvery time he used to open his desk,\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,010\r\nthere\'d be another wasp in there.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,060\r\nWe were awful to him,\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,030\r\nand it was a jungle there.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,010\r\nAnd so our upbringing, our first experience really\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,080\r\nof socialization\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,000\r\nprobably doesn\'t encourage assertiveness.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,060\r\nAnd the role models that we have at that age.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,030\r\nThey might be our parents who might be great role models,\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,050\r\nbut may not.\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,000\r\nThey might be rock stars.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,090\r\nThey might be people in films.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,090\r\nAction heroes or cartoon princesses.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,030\r\nIt\'s pretty random who our role models are.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,080\r\nAnd often they\'re not very constructive\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,050\r\nwhen it comes to learning to be assertive\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,080\r\nin real life difficult situations.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,090\r\nSo that\'s two reasons already.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,060\r\nThe animal side of us and then our upbringing.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,070\r\nBut there\'s a third reason why assertiveness is difficult.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,070\r\nAnd that\'s that the other two options\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,090\r\nof being aggressive and being too submissive or passive,\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,030\r\nboth have perceived payoffs which are quite tempting.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,030\r\nBut actually are not as good as we hope.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,090\r\nThey\'re only perceived payoffs.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,040\r\nIf you think about the payoff of being aggressive.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000\r\nYou tend to think that if you\'re aggressive\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,060\r\nyou\'re going to bend other people to your will,\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,030\r\nand you\'re going to get what you want.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,080\r\nAnd being aggressive can work sometimes,\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,050\r\nbut all too often it doesn\'t work,\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,040\r\nbecause the other person will fight back\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,070\r\nor they\'ll get revenge later.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,030\r\nYou\'ll make an enemy, and it\'ll cost you more in the end.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,020\r\nAnd so being aggressive is not a good life strategy overall.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,050\r\nWhat about being a submissive?\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,090\r\nWhat about letting other people have their way\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,070\r\nin the hope that they\'re going to like you?\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,020\r\nAnd the perceived payoff is that you\'ll have an easy life\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,090\r\nand you\'ll be liked.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,030\r\nBut of course, instead of saying something at the time,\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,090\r\nyou end up bottling it up.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,080\r\nYou end up not getting what you want,\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,000\r\nand it all it does is add to your stress,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000\r\nand you never get closure.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,010\r\nI\'ll give you a quick example of a time\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,060\r\nwhen I wasn\'t assertive enough.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,050\r\nI used to share an office with a guy called Paul.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,090\r\nAnd he used to irritate me anyway,\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,070\r\n\'cause he used to not answer my phone when I was away.\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,080\r\nHe never left me messages.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,020\r\nI used to leave him messages of people who\'d called.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,010\r\nBut one day he did something which really upset me,\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,050\r\nwas he brought his lunch back to the office,\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,080\r\nand he was eating fried egg and baked beans.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,050\r\nAnd the whole office stank of beans.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,050\r\nAnd I remember thinking if he does it again,\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,010\r\nI\'m going to say something to him about it.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,060\r\nBut I thought I won\'t say something this time.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,020\r\nI\'ll wait and I\'ll see if he does it a second time\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,060\r\nand then I\'ll say something.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,050\r\nBut he never did it again.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,040\r\nAnd the ridiculous thing is\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,050\r\nI\'ve still got that thought in my mind years later\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,090\r\nthat if he does it again I\'ll say something.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,090\r\nBecause I never got closure on it.\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,010\r\nI never needed to.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010\r\nAnd of course what probably have happened\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,060\r\nis if he\'d done it again I would have bottled it up\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040\r\nuntil he\'d done it about five times,\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,020\r\nand then suddenly I would have flipped\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060\r\nfrom being too submissive to being aggressive.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,040\r\nAnd I suddenly would have gone,\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,050\r\nPaul, stop eating those beans!\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,040\r\nAnd then that would have been totally the wrong approach.\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070\r\nHe would\'ve said, \"Well I didn\'t know it was a problem.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,010\r\n\"You never told me.\"\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,080\r\nSo bottling it up and then exploding and swinging\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,010\r\nfrom one end of the scale to the other is not a good plan.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,030\r\nSulking, what can we do about this?\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,090\r\nI suppose the first thing is to realize\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,020\r\nthat we are animals.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,050\r\nWe have to make allowance for the fact\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,060\r\nthat we\'ve got these chemicals that go through our systems.\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,050\r\nAnd then we should use the power of our conscious brains\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,070\r\nto take control of how we react.\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,050\r\nTo think before we act, because we do have control\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,080\r\nover how we act in situations.\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,010\r\nAnd that\'s really what this course is about.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,080\r\nBeing aware of yourself in situations,\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040\r\nand then using the best strategies for those.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,000\r\nSo I\'d like you start thinking about situations\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040\r\nwhere maybe you could\'ve been more assertive.\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,030\r\nMaybe you became a bit more aggressive\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,020\r\nthan you should\'ve been, or maybe where you were too passive\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,090\r\nand you let other people get away with things,\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,080\r\nwhich is retrospect,\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080\r\nyou shouldn\'t have let them get away with.\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,070\r\nStart thinking about those situations\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,010\r\nand start thinking about whether\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,000\r\nthe middle way would\'ve been more productive for you.\r\n\r\n"

okay and they are,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,090\r\nthat\'s where assertiveness is\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,050\r\nand that\'s where we want to be.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:35,050

is not.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060\r\nThis is the aggressive box, and there are\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,020\r\npeople who naturally gravitate to this box.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,090\r\nTheir starting position is, \"The world is stupid.\"\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,000\r\nI\'ve got an example of this\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,090\r\nsomebody told me about in a hospital.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,030\r\nThere was a doctor there who had touched a patient,\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,090\r\nand he was washing his hands after doing that.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,010\r\nWhen he looked around there were no towels,\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010\r\nso he pulled the curtain down off the wall,\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,070\r\ndried his hands on the curtain,\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,030\r\nand just threw it away on the floor and said,\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,080\r\n\"Nurse, there\'s no towels!\"\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,030\r\nAnd that\'s really aggressive.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,040\r\nHis belief is that he\'s the\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,010\r\nonly person with a brain in that place,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,080\r\nand the rest of them are all idiots;\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,050\r\nThat\'s really aggressive.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,010\r\nNot a good starting point.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,040\r\nThat\'s gonna harm the results that that doctor gets.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,050\r\nIf he needs help from other people they\'re not\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,090\r\ngonna be on his side, it\'s not a good starting point.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,070\r\nThe nurses on the other hand in that situation,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,060\r\nthey were pushed into the bottom left,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,060\r\ninto the \"I\'m not okay\" box.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,070\r\nThey were submissively hiding behind\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,090\r\none of the beds probably,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,040\r\nthinking, \"Oh no, we\'ve probably upset the doctor.\"\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,060\r\nAnd you might think,\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060\r\n\"Not many people are gonna be in the I\'m not okay box.\"\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,070\r\nBut actually it\'s very easy to be in the not okay box.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,060\r\nDo you like the sight of yourself in a mirror?\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,070\r\nDo you like the sound of your voice\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,070\r\non an answer phone message?\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,030\r\nAnd people are often not even okay about\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,030\r\nhow they look or how they sound.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030\r\nLet alone all of the other intricacies of their personality.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,090\r\nThe thing is that the world is trying\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,070\r\nto push us down into this not okay box.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,090\r\nYou look at women\'s magazines, they\'ve got beautiful people,\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,000\r\nairbrushed, looking perfect.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000\r\nAnd there\'s pressure on us\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,060\r\nto look like the women on the cover,\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,090\r\nor the man on the cover of men\'s magazines\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,090\r\nincreasingly as well.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,050\r\nSo it\'s very important to believe that you\'re okay\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,020\r\nand to have, maybe a mantra, which is,\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,010\r\n\"Nobody\'s gonna push me into the not okay box.\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,070\r\n\"I\'m okay as a person.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,020\r\n\"I\'m not perfect, but I\'m good enough,\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,040\r\n\"and the world is not gonna tell me that I\'m not.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,060\r\n\"I\'ll decide whether I\'m okay or not.\"\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,070\r\nNow there is one more box that I haven\'t mentioned:\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,080\r\nThe I\'m not okay and the world is also not okay box.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,090\r\nThis box is unsustainable, you can\'t live in this box.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,060\r\nApparently teenagers quite often start in the bottom left,\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,030\r\nfeeling not okay, maybe they\'re spotty,\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,000\r\nthey can\'t get a girlfriend, everything\'s too difficult.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,010\r\nAnd then as they start to lose respect for their parents\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,050\r\nand discover their parents don\'t know all the answers either\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,090\r\nthey start to move across into that bottom right box.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,000\r\nBut of course the problem is then you\'ve\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080\r\ngot nothing to cling to at all, nothing\'s all right.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,070\r\nThe theory goes that you have to come out\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,040\r\neither by going upwards into the aggressive box of,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040\r\n\"(scoffs) Everybody\'s a fool, they don\'t understand me.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,060\r\n\"They\'ve got no taste in cloths,\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,020\r\n\"they\'ve got no musical taste.\"\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,010\r\nOr they have to go back into the depressed box of,\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,000\r\n\"Oh, I\'m just not good enough.\"\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,030\r\nBut hopefully whichever box they come out into\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,020\r\nthey will eventually find their way up into that\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,010\r\ntop left box of believing that they\'re not too bad, really,\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,000\r\nand the world isn\'t too bad really,\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,060\r\nand they can get on with life.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,000\r\nI\'d like you to just think about yourself,\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,070\r\nwhich is your home box.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,050\r\nDo you tend to be a bit too not okay about yourself,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,090\r\nor do you tend to assume that other people are not okay?\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,030\r\nHopefully you\'re safely in that top left box\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,010\r\nof believing that you\'re okay and that everyone else is.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,020\r\nNow remember: You decide whether you\'re okay.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,000\r\nNobody else can push you into that not okay box.\r\n\r\n"

yet,\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,020\r\nwhich is passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,060\r\nWe\'ve only been looking at passive or submissive,\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,090\r\nthey mean the same thing.\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,010\r\nAnd aggressive, and then assertive as the right way.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,090\r\nBut what about if you didn\'t respect anybody\'s rights?\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,040\r\nNot yours or theirs.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,080\r\nThat would be passive-aggressive,\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,000\r\nand this is really the worst combination.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,060\r\nIt\'s not a halfway point, it\'s a lose-lose situation.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,080\r\nI\'m gonna give you a quick example of this,\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,030\r\na story somebody told me on a training course,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,050\r\nI\'m sure it\'s true.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,020\r\nShe just bought this new car,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020\r\nit\'s quite a cheap make of car.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,040\r\nBut it was new, it\'s the first ever new car she\'d had,\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,060\r\nshe was really proud of it.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,090\r\nShe drove to the super-market in it.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,060\r\nAnd when she got there,\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,070\r\nshe pulled up next to a Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,010\r\nand there was a very posh lady\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,090\r\nwho was driving the Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,050\r\nand when the posh lady got out,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,080\r\nshe just slammed her door into the side of this new car,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,050\r\nand it put a big dent in the side of the car.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,040\r\nThose Rolls-Royce doors are really heavy.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,090\r\nThe Rolls-Royce lady didn\'t even notice,\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,070\r\nshe just banged into the car, got out,\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,090\r\nand she just walked her way to the super-market.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,060\r\nMeanwhile, the lady who\'d turned up\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,030\r\nin her pride and joy new car,\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,060\r\nwent running around to the side,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,070\r\nhad a look and saw the dent.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,010\r\nNow, what would you do if that happened to you?\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,080\r\nReally, you\'ve got various options.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,020\r\nYou could be passive and just think,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,080\r\n\"Ugh, typical of my luck.\"\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,020\r\nYou could be aggressive and go and shout at the woman,\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,050\r\n\"You\'ve ruined my car!\"\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,050\r\nOf course, the best option is to be assertive\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,080\r\nand to go running after the lady and say,\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,050\r\n\"Excuse me, you probably didn\'t notice,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,020\r\n\"you\'ve just dented my car,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,030\r\n\"would you be able to pay for it?\"\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,090\r\nShe\'d probably be fine about paying for it,\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,080\r\nso it\'d probably be fine.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,050\r\nBut the worst option, the fourth one,\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,000\r\nis to be passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,090\r\nAnd this is what the lady actually did.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,050\r\nShe got out her keys of her brand new car\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,030\r\nand she went up and down the side of the Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,020\r\ngreat big scratch down the Rolls-Royce.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,040\r\nIf you think about it, that\'s just lose-lose,\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,090\r\nit doesn\'t help anybody.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nBecause her new car still got a dent,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,000\r\nnow the Rolls-Royce is scratched as well.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,030\r\nShe\'s being aggressive, not against the woman,\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,080\r\nbut against her car,\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,010\r\nand that doesn\'t solve anything.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,060\r\nShe\'s gonna come back to her car and think,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,050\r\n\"Ugh, look what someone\'s done.\"\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,080\r\nShe\'s not even gonna know why.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080\r\nPassive-aggressive is quite a tempting option,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,050\r\nbecause the chemicals are in our blood,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,090\r\nwe feel aggressive,\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,050\r\nbut we\'re not actually assertive enough to actually\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,020\r\nconfront the person, so we take it out against the car.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,000\r\nA common work example of passive-aggressive\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000\r\nwould be criticizing people behind their back.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080\r\nYou\'re being aggressive about the person,\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,060\r\nbut you\'re being passive in terms of,\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,010\r\nyou\'re not actually confronting them.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,000\r\nSo, you might find it interesting just to think about,\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,020\r\nhave you been passive-aggressive at all recently?\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,000\r\nIs it a tendency that you have?\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,060\r\nAnd what would the assertive option look like?\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060\r\nWhat would it look and feel like to calmly\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,000\r\nconfront the person and tell them about\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000\r\nhow you feel, and what you would like to happen.\r\n\r\n"

consists of learned habits\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,020\r\nthat you\'ve built up during your life so far.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,090\r\nAnd these are known as life scripts.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,070\r\nExamples of life scripts could be:\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,000\r\nI\'m impatient.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,020\r\nI\'m shy.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,000\r\nI hate giving talks.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040\r\nI always think of the best thing to say afterwards\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,020\r\nwhen it\'s too late.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,080\r\nThose are typical life scripts.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,070\r\nYou can have good scripts too.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,060\r\nLike I\'m good under pressure.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,000\r\nI love giving talks.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000\r\nI like meeting new people.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,060\r\nAny statement that starts with,\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,000\r\n\"I can\'t help,\" or \"I always seem to,\"\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,090\r\nor \"I\'m hopeless at,\" or \"I\'m great at,\"\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,020\r\nthese are all scripts.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,060\r\nAnd they can be changed.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,020\r\nScripts get stronger with time,\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,030\r\nbecause beliefs lead to thoughts and behaviors,\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,000\r\nwhich then lead to events happening.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,020\r\nAnd these strengthen your beliefs.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,030\r\nI know I\'m impatient.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,070\r\nI\'ve got 50 years of evidence of myself\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,090\r\nstamping my feet in cues.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,060\r\nAnd my belief about myself leads to my behavior,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,070\r\nwhich gives me more and more evidence that that\'s how I am.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,000\r\nSo to change yourself means\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,030\r\nchanging at the very least your behaviors,\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,020\r\nbut ideally your underlying thoughts and beliefs\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,060\r\nabout yourself too.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,080\r\nBut can this be done?\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,040\r\nAnd the answer is yes.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000\r\nAnd you can do it by changing your self talk.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,010\r\nThe words that you say in your head.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,020\r\nYour subconscious is listening to everything\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020\r\nthat you say to yourself.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,030\r\nBy the way, do you have a voice in your head?\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,040\r\nOne voice in your head is good.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,070\r\nHopefully you haven\'t got two voices\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,070\r\nthat are arguing with each other.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,040\r\nSo most people have one talking voice,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nand this talking voice is your conscious mind.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nAnd the silent listener that\'s also in your head\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,050\r\nis your subconscious, which then acts\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,090\r\non whatever you tell it.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,060\r\nIt\'s quite a scary thought.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,070\r\nSo if you say, \"When I give this presentation\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,070\r\n\"it\'s going to go horribly wrong,\"\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,010\r\nyour subconscious listens to that, it acts on that,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,070\r\nand it then makes the talk go horribly wrong.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,090\r\nSo if you can change your self talk\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,000\r\nto only positive statements,\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,060\r\nyour subconscious will hear these,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,090\r\nand gradually it will come to believe you,\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,030\r\nuntil the new state has become true.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,080\r\nSo if you say, \"I love giving talks.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080\r\n\"I\'m looking forward to the big\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,050\r\n\"conference that\'s coming up,\"\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,040\r\nat first it will feel very weird.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,050\r\nYou\'ll feel something called cognitive dissonance,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,000\r\nwhich is where you consciously say,\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,020\r\n\"I\'m looking forward to the talk,\"\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,080\r\nand your subconscious says, \"What?\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,090\r\n\"He\'s never said this before.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,020\r\n\"This can\'t be true.\"\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,030\r\nBut after awhile, you start to accept it.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030\r\nYour subconscious starts to think that...\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,090\r\nThat something\'s changed somewhere,\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,040\r\nand maybe you are actually looking forward\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,090\r\nto giving the talk.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,050\r\nAnd the battleship of 50 years of experience and evidence\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,090\r\nis starting to be slowly turned.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,050\r\nAnd you just keep pushing and pushing\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,060\r\na little bit every day.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060\r\nPositive statements every day.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,000\r\nAnd you can change anything\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000\r\nyou want to change about yourself.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,020\r\nAnd it only takes about a month.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020\r\nWhich is amazing, isn\'t it?\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060\r\nSo, what\'s your pet negative script\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060\r\nthat you\'d like to change?\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,080\r\nWhat aspect of your personality and behavior\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040\r\nwould you like to change?\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,020\r\nDesign a new script today\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,040\r\nand start repeating it every day\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000\r\nuntil it becomes the new

of your negative emotions?\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,010\r\nGet rid of worry, fear, anger, hate,\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,080\r\njealousy, regret, blame, impatience,\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,060\r\nembarrassment, guilt.\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,050\r\nYes, of course you would.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,050\r\nAlthough some people have a couple of\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,040\r\npet negative emotions they want to cling to,\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,060\r\nI\'ll let you keep a couple of your\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,020\r\nfavorite ones if you\'d like.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,000\r\nAlthough really, why would you?\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040\r\nTo get rid of any negative emotion,\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,050\r\nthe first step is taking responsibility.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,050\r\nRealizing that you are responsible for\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090\r\nmost situations that you find yourself in,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,010\r\nand you are always responsible for\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,000\r\nhow you handle that situation.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040\r\nOften, the things that make us most angry\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,070\r\nare things that we know are our fault, really.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,020\r\nWe\'ll take another negative emotion, worry.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,070\r\nOnce we realize that we need to take responsibility\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,040\r\nfor the outcome rather than just worrying about it,\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,040\r\nwe can start to plan and work on getting it right,\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,000\r\nand the worry is reduced.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,060\r\nI think it\'s amazing that responsibility is involved in\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,050\r\npretty much every negative emotion, when you think about it.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,090\r\nJealousy, blame, regret, guilt.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,080\r\nBut the more I think about it,\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040\r\nthe more convinced I am that this is true.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,060\r\nI suppose you could say that you\'re responsible\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,000\r\neven for whether you choose that negative emotion at all.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,090\r\nAre you aware that you are choosing negative emotions?\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,030\r\nIt may feel that they automatically\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,030\r\nspring up from within you.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,030\r\nBut think about it,\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,080\r\nmaybe you\'re responsible for choosing them.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,050\r\nDid you choose to get angry?\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,080\r\nOr, to put it another way,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,090\r\ncould you choose to not get angry?\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,010\r\nI think you could.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,030\r\nSo, why would someone choose\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,000\r\na negative emotion like anger or guilt?\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000\r\nWell, we\'re choosing them due to false payoffs.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nWe believe we\'re gonna get a payoff,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,050\r\nwhich we actually don\'t really get.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,080\r\nLet\'s look at both anger and guilt\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,090\r\nand look at the false payoffs.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,000\r\nWhat would be the payoff that you\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000\r\nmight get from becoming angry?\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,030\r\nWell, I think there are two payoffs\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,010\r\nwe think we\'re gonna get.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,080\r\nOne is that it will make us stronger.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000\r\nBut actually, does it make you stronger if you get angry?\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000\r\nAre you most likely to get\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000\r\nwhat you want by getting angry?\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,020\r\nAnd I would say, probably not.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,010\r\nThe other payoff is a feeling\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,060\r\nthat we might be able to let off steam\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,090\r\nand feel better afterwards.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,020\r\nBut actually, do you feel better\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,010\r\nafter you\'ve got angry?\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,080\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,050\r\nOnce you realize that actually,\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,010\r\nanger doesn\'t make you stronger,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,090\r\nand it doesn\'t give you a feeling\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,060\r\nof letting off steam and feeling better afterwards,\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,090\r\nyou can then decide to not choose anger.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,040\r\nMoving on to guilt, the second one,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080\r\nwhat are the payoffs we might think\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,020\r\nthat we\'re gonna get from guilt?\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,000\r\nI think, again, there are two main ones.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,090\r\nOne is that maybe feeling guilty\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,040\r\nabout something you\'ve done makes you feel\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,010\r\nthat you\'re an okay person, really.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,080\r\nEven though you did a bad thing,\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,030\r\nat least you\'re a good person.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,040\r\nBut on the other hand,\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,030\r\ndoes guilt make you an okay person\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,020\r\nafter you\'ve done a bad thing?\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,030\r\nAnd I would say, \"No, it doesn\'t.\"\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,040\r\nYou did the bad thing.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,090\r\nThe other payoff that you might think you get from guilt,\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,090\r\nis that it makes less likely to do the bad thing again.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,020\r\nBut again, do you get that payoff?\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,070\r\nAnd I would say, probably not.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,030\r\nI think guilt almost gives you permission\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,090\r\nto keep doing the bad thing,\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,020\r\nat least you feel guilty every time you do it.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,020\r\nSo, I think guilt is actually gonna make you\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,060\r\nmore likely to keep doing that bad thing.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,040\r\nOnce you realize that you\'re choosing these emotions,\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000\r\nand that the payoffs that you think you\'re\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,050\r\ngonna get are actually false,\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,060\r\nyou can then begin to choose to not have them.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,010\r\nWhat would a life of no guilt be like?\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,080\r\nWould it possible to get rid of guilt?\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,010\r\nWhen you start thinking about this,\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,040\r\nthere are two main ways that you could\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,020\r\nlive a life free from guilt.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020\r\nOne would be, to be a complete angel.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020\r\nTo be perfect, never do a bad thing.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,040\r\nI think that would be impossible,\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040\r\nAt least it would for me.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,050\r\nThe other option would be to be a complete devil.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,040\r\nDo bad things all the time, and not care.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,020\r\nI think we all agree,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,040\r\nthat would be an unacceptable option.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,030\r\nBut of course, what about a mixture of these two things.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,070\r\nIf you could be a mixture of the angel option\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,000\r\nand the devil option,\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,020\r\nthat would be possible to do, that would work.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,080\r\nFor example, when my neighbor\'s cat comes\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,090\r\nthrough into my garden, trying to eat my goldfish\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,040\r\nthat I\'ve got in my pond,\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,060\r\nI could squirt the cat with my garden hose.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020\r\nBut if I did, I\'d feel bad about that,\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,040\r\nI\'d feel guilty about that.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080\r\nSo, I\'m gonna choose the angel option for that,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,050\r\nand I\'m gonna not do it.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,000\r\nWhen it comes to eating a second doughnut,\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,060\r\nI think I\'m gonna go for the devil option\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,040\r\nand just do that.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040\r\nIf I have a mixture of the angel choice\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,020\r\nand the devil choice in my life,\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,010\r\nI can live a life free from guilt.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,080\r\nThe answer to get rid of guilt is actually\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,090\r\nto change what you do, which is the angel option.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,050\r\nOr, change what you say to yourself,\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,050\r\nwhich is the devil option,\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,070\r\nand banish guilt forever.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,040\r\nIt\'s the same for all other negative emotions.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,080\r\nI want you to think about, what\'s your pet one?\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,090\r\nWhat\'s the payoff that you think you\'re getting from it?\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,070\r\nAnd is that payoff forced?\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,000\r\nWhich, of course, it is.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000\r\nAnd then, decide not to have that\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000\r\nnegative emotion in your life anymore.\r\n\r\n"

put-downs.\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,010\r\nWhen someone puts you down verbally,\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,010\r\nit\'s really a form of aggression.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,050\r\nMost aggression these days is actually\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050\r\nnot physical, it\'s verbal.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,040\r\nAnd as we\'ve seen,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,090\r\nthe temptation is to be aggressive back,\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,080\r\nor to be submissive and let them get away with it.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,020\r\nBut to confront them assertively would be the best option.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,000\r\nThe one that\'s most likely to give you a successful outcome.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\r\nSome examples of common put-downs at work\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,020\r\nwould be things like,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,030\r\nstereotyping you, patronizing you,\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,010\r\ninterfering with your work,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,020\r\nignoring things that you\'ve said,\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,070\r\nimplying that you have a fault\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,090\r\nor are under-performing,\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,090\r\nwithout actually coming out and saying it.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,000\r\nAnd using emotive words like \"stupid\",\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000\r\nor \"useless\", or \"that was a crazy decision\".\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,050\r\nThese are all types of everyday put-downs.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,010\r\nThe approach to take with these types\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nof verbal aggression is, number one,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,000\r\nto realize that it is aggression.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080\r\nNumber two, to realize that they may not\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,040\r\nbe a bad person, maybe they don\'t realize\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,020\r\nthat they have an effectively\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,070\r\nanti-social habit, like interrupting.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,030\r\nOr maybe they\'re having a bad day.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,000\r\nBut then number three, to decide that you\'re not\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,090\r\ngoing to be submissive and taken.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,000\r\nBut you\'re also not going to bite back aggressively.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080\r\nNumber four, then, is to remain calm,\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,050\r\nand speak calmly to them.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,090\r\nEven if you decide to tell someone\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,060\r\nthat you\'re very upset by what they\'ve just said,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,050\r\ndo it calmly.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,060\r\nNumber five is to tell them how you feel,\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000\r\nand what you would like them to do differently next time.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,090\r\nI\'ll cover the exact words for how to do this\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,080\r\nin a later video on this course.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,030\r\nIt feels good to remain calm,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,020\r\nand it feels good to be nice.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,000\r\nDo you find that?\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,070\r\nBeing nice to someone horrible\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,040\r\ngives you a great feeling of control,\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,010\r\nand they usually apologize to you later.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,070\r\nSo, I\'d like you to ask yourself\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,060\r\nwhat types of put-down you sometimes,\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nor often experience at work.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,090\r\nAnd then plan your answer.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,020\r\nImagine yourself calmly telling them that,\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,090\r\nfor example, you don\'t like being interrupted,\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,010\r\nand you\'d like to just finish your statement.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,070\r\nOr maybe, when they say,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,050\r\n\"That\'s typical of a technician!\"\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,020\r\nThat you\'d like to be given the chance to show\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,030\r\nthat your plan is a good one.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,080\r\nPlan how you\'re going to tell them how you feel,\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,040\r\nand what you want them to do differently in future,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000\r\nwhen they deal with you.\r\n\r\n"

response,\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,020\r\nthere\'s a tiny moment when you can decide\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,050\r\nhow you will react.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,000\r\nYou\'ve already seen how you can do this\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,030\r\nwith negative emotions and choose not to have them.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,050\r\nBut you can also take control of what you say and do,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,060\r\nwhen dealing with someone aggressive.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,000\r\nFirst, ask yourself if it\'s their problem or yours.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,020\r\nMaybe what they\'re doing is fine,\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,040\r\nand it\'s you that has the problem with it.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,010\r\nFor example, people playing music next door.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,010\r\nMaybe it\'s not that late in the evening,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,060\r\nand they\'re entitled to some fun.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,000\r\nDoes it matter that much?\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,010\r\nThe person who\'s irritating you immensely\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,060\r\nin the meeting by checking his messages on his phone.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,010\r\nIs it affecting you?\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,030\r\nIs it such a big deal?\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,020\r\nIs it a battle worth fighting?\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,060\r\nMaybe the problem\'s in your head.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,000\r\nThis is the first detachment question.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nIs it worth getting involved?\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,050\r\nOne more example of this,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,060\r\nmy next-door neighbor used to drop in,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,040\r\nand he would criticize aspects of my house.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,090\r\nHe would say,\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,070\r\n\"Oh, I see you\'ve got your new windows, Chris.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,060\r\n\"What did you go for?\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,090\r\n\"Oh, you went for the plastic ones.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,090\r\n\"I wouldn\'t have done that,\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,020\r\n\"but still, it\'s up to you.\"\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,090\r\nIt used to be really annoying.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,000\r\nBut then, his behavior was his problem, not mine.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,020\r\nSo, maybe it was best just to be detached\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,070\r\nand just quietly laugh at it rather than getting annoyed.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,010\r\nThe second detachment question is,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,060\r\n\"What\'s my objective in this situation,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,050\r\n\"and what\'s the best way to get it?\"\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,060\r\nOnce you know what you want to achieve,\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,020\r\nyou can calmly act without emotion\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,010\r\nin order to get it.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,000\r\nI play in a band in my spare time,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,060\r\nand we have a bass player of questionable abilities,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,030\r\nand the guitarist is always criticizing him\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,030\r\nbehind his back.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,020\r\n\"Did you hear what he played on that last song?\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,090\r\n\"It was rubbish!\"\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,040\r\nAnd my question is always,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,060\r\n\"What do you want to do about it?\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,010\r\n\"Do you think we should tell him?\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,010\r\n\"Should we get him to write the chords down?\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,000\r\n\"Would you want to replace him?\"\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,020\r\nThe guitar player never has an answer to this.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,030\r\nHe would rather waste time complaining\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,060\r\nthan have a clear objective,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,060\r\nand then calmly put it into practice.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,020\r\nSo, are you detached enough?\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,020\r\nDo you take on things that are not worth the effort,\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,030\r\nor are never going to succeed?\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,050\r\nWhat can you detach from and just let it go?\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,070\r\nIn the situations that you are determined to change,\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,030\r\ndo you have clear objectives\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,000\r\nthat are feasible for you to achieve?\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,070\r\nAre there situations about which you are unhappy,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,090\r\nbut where you don\'t yet have a plan\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,020\r\nfor what you are going to do?\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,000\r\nTake a moment from this course to think\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000\r\nabout these important questions.\r\n\r\n"

Am I right?\"\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,060\r\nNow this could be done during the meeting\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nor it could be done one-to-one afterwards.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,040\r\nYou can pick them up and say,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,050\r\n\"During the meeting I just had a feeling each time\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,090\r\n\'I said this, I noticed this\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,090\r\n\'and I just interpret it as this; am I right?\"\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,000\r\nIt\'s non-aggressive.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,010\r\nIt\'s just clarifying.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,060\r\nWhat are they going to do when you say this?\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,050\r\nWell, they\'ve really only got two options.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,060\r\nThey can either say, \"No sorry,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,030\r\n\'I didn\'t mean anything by it.\"\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,000\r\nSome people just have unfortunate body language.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,010\r\nBut the other thing is, they may say, \"Well yeah, actually\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,020\r\n\'I do think that the production department are not\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,050\r\n\'doing their job properly; been late on the last three jobs\"\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,050\r\nor whatever, \"And this is what I want\".\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,080\r\nSo we can have a decent conversation about what\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,060\r\nthe problem is.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,020\r\nWe flushed it out.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,050\r\nSo what we\'re doing here is we\'re clarifying\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,060\r\nwith this little technique.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000\r\nSo have you had any recent examples\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,090\r\nwhen you could have used this?\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,040\r\nWere there some situations that came up in meetings\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,010\r\nor just to one-to-one perhaps\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,060\r\nwhere the person\'s body language\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,040\r\nwas a little bit aggressive?\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,020\r\nOr, are there any people who tend to use subtly aggressive\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,040\r\nbody language that you can try this out on?\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,020\r\nI\'d like you just to think about that.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,000\r\nHow could you apply this technique?\r\n\r\n"

other person.\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,040\r\nMaybe the words that they\'re using\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000\r\nor the emotions that they\'re having.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,020\r\nSo in terms of the words, if they describe a decision\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,030\r\nas stupid or crazy\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,000\r\nyou could pick them up on those words and say,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\r\n\"Well I agree that the decision in retrospect\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040\r\n\"could have been better but I think it\'s a bit harsh\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,020\r\n\"to call it crazy.\"\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,010\r\nAnd then if necessary you could point out\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,090\r\ntheir behavior and emotional state as well.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,090\r\nFor example if somebody\'s shouting at you\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,050\r\nyou can say to them,\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,020\r\n\"You\'re shouting at me and disturbing everyone\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,060\r\n\"else in the office.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,040\r\n\"Is this the best way to resolve this problem?\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,070\r\n\"Maybe we could meet later when\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,050\r\n\"you\'re in a calmer mood.\"\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,000\r\nSo you calmly point out their behavior and their emotions\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000\r\nand this works because often people aren\'t\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,060\r\nconscious of their behavior.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,090\r\nThey\'ve slipped into autopilot.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,020\r\nAnd the hope is that they\'ll say,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,010\r\n\"Oh yeah, sorry about that.\"\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,020\r\nIf they say,\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,010\r\n\"I\'ll damn well shout if I want to!\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,050\r\n\"I\'m really annoyed!\"\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,030\r\nthen you now know what you\'re dealing with\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,070\r\nand you\'re fully justified in saying\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,050\r\n\"Well I\'m not going to try to resolve this\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,040\r\n\"when you\'re in that state, we\'ll talk in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,000\r\nPointing out their behavior can also be used\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,090\r\nto show that you\'re on to their game.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,020\r\nFor example a perennial problem I get\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,070\r\nis trying to get a gig in a pub\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,000\r\nand trying to get a meeting with the landlord\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,010\r\nand there\'s always somebody saying,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000\r\n\"Oh he\'s not here I\'m afraid.\"\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040\r\nI suspect he probably is there upstairs\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,020\r\nand just isn\'t talking to visitors.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,010\r\nSo the thing is to comment on the process\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,000\r\nand say to them,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040\r\n\"Well I\'ve been in several times now\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,050\r\n\"and these random visits just aren\'t working\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,070\r\n\"so can you help me and maybe suggest\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,080\r\n\"a better way to contact him?\"\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,030\r\nSo by highlighting the process you\'re saying\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,040\r\n\"I\'m on to your game, it can\'t go on,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,060\r\n\"we need to find another way.\"\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,090\r\nAsking them for help is quite powerful too.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,060\r\nSo maybe there are people in your work\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,050\r\nor your personal life who would benefit\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,040\r\nfrom having their aggressive words pointed out\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,060\r\nor their unhelpful behaviors calmly highlighted.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,050\r\nCan you think of some recent situations\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,060\r\nwhere you could\'ve done this?\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,040\r\nSo that you can be ready for them\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,000\r\nwhen it next happens.\r\n\r\n"

someone something\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,010\r\nthat they\'re not going to like hearing?\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,040\r\nAnd this could be anything from,\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,010\r\ntelling your boss that you want a raise,\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,000\r\ntelling somebody that the noise of their music\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080\r\nthrough the wall is keeping you awake,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,090\r\nwanting to tell somebody that their meeting is badly run,\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,010\r\nit could be anything, at home or at work.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,090\r\nWouldn\'t it be amazing if there was a magic\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,020\r\nfour-step process that you could use\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,000\r\nthat would work in any situation.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,090\r\nAnd there is, and I\'m gonna go through it with you now.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,050\r\nNow this four-step process isn\'t actually\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,070\r\nguaranteed to work in any situation.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,000\r\nThis isn\'t gonna work if the person has no vested interest\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040\r\nin a good working relationship with you.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,080\r\nBut of course, in most home and work situations,\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,050\r\nthe other person does have a vested interest\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,090\r\nin keeping the relationship going, in which case,\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,040\r\nthis four-step process is absolutely the best thing to use.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,090\r\nThe four-step process has the basic outline of\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,030\r\nI understand, I feel, I want, Is that OK?\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,000\r\nSo it consists of, first of all,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,020\r\nunderstanding their position and showing that\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,000\r\nyou understand their position.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,050\r\nSecondly, explaining to them clearly how you feel.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,060\r\nAnd we\'ve already said you\'re gonna do this\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,040\r\ncalmly and quietly, saying how you feel.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,010\r\nNot using facts and logic, but feelings.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,020\r\nThe third bit is to say what you want from the situation,\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,050\r\nand a bit of planning beforehand might be required\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,010\r\nto decide what it is that you want.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,070\r\nAnd then the fourth one is to say, \"Is that OK?\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,090\r\n\"Is that a reasonable request do you think?\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,020\r\n\"Could you do that for me?\"\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,020\r\nI\'ll give you an example of this and then I\'ll explain\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,070\r\nwhy this process is so important.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,090\r\nSuppose somebody\'s interrupting you\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,030\r\nwhen you\'re busy at work.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,060\r\nYou could just say, \"Go away I\'m busy,\"\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,000\r\nbut that\'s quite aggressive.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,060\r\nA nice assertive answer would be to use my\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,040\r\nfour-step process and you\'d say,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,050\r\n\"I understand how urgent this is and see why you want it,\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,000\r\n\"but I just feel a bit under pressure at the moment\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,060\r\n\"with this work I\'m doing here.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060\r\n\"I\'m doing this report.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,030\r\n\"I need to get it done by lunch time.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,020\r\n\"Maybe we could talk this afternoon.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,030\r\n\"Would that be OK?\"\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,020\r\nSo you just follow the four-step process.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,060\r\nIt tells you what to say.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,070\r\nNow, why these four steps in the order they are?\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,000\r\nAnd the reason is that steps two and three\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000\r\nare the slightly aggressive ones.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,010\r\nThe feel and the want steps of,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,070\r\nyou know, \"I don\'t wanna talk to you now.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,080\r\n\"Can we do it later?\"\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,070\r\nis quite aggressive if you waded straight into that.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,070\r\nBut they\'ve got this fluffy exterior of steps one and four.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,010\r\nSo you say, \"I do understand, but,\"\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,000\r\nI feel like this, I want this.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080\r\n\"Is that OK?\"\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,070\r\nSo, it\'s nice the way that two and three\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,020\r\nhave got steps one and four outside them.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,000\r\nThat\'s why they\'re in that order.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000\r\nAnd all four of them must be done.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060\r\nIf you miss one of them out,\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,080\r\nit won\'t be anything like as effective.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,050\r\nNow, after you\'ve done step four,\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,000\r\nthere are two things that they might say.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,060\r\nThey may yes or they may say no.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,070\r\nNow what if they say yes and then they don\'t do it?\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,020\r\nThey go, \"Yep, we\'re really sorry.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,070\r\n\"We\'ll turn the music down.\"\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,040\r\nAnd then they don\'t.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,080\r\nWell, that\'s relatively straightforward because now\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,030\r\nyou can get them on not keeping their promise.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,090\r\nYou can go back and say, \"Do you remember we had\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,050\r\n\"that little conversation ten minutes ago\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,090\r\n\"and you said you\'d turn the music down?\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,020\r\n\"And you haven\'t.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,060\r\n\"Would it be possible to do that for me please?\"\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,040\r\nSo once you\'ve got a yes out of them, it\'s fairly easy\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,070\r\nto go back and say you haven\'t done what you said you\'d do.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,090\r\nBut what if they say, \"No, I\'m just not prepared to do that.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,010\r\n\"It\'s my party, I\'m having music, get stuffed.\"\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,050\r\nWhat can you do then?\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,080\r\nAnd what I\'d recommend if they say no is,\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,010\r\ngo back around again.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,030\r\nAnd you can say, \"Well, I do understand it\'s your party.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,060\r\n\"It\'s great that you\'re doing that, but I really am\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,080\r\n\"upset about the noise and all I want\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,060\r\n\"is for you to turn it down a little bit.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,020\r\n\"Surely you could do that for me.\"\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,040\r\nSo you go back around and you just jack up the words\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,060\r\na little bit with, \"I really feel strongly,\"\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,020\r\nand \"All I want\".\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,030\r\nAnd if you go back around a second time,\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,070\r\nit\'s gonna be a pretty good chance that it\'s gonna work.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,060\r\nNow, I just want to finally stress with this that\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,030\r\nthis is not designed to batter the person into submission.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,000\r\nWe might be looking for some sort of working compromise\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,020\r\nthat both parties can be happy with.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,090\r\nBecause, as we\'ve said earlier on this course,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,020\r\nit\'s all about rights.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,030\r\nYou\'ve got rights but so have they.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,000\r\nAnd sometimes what you\'ll find is the other person\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070\r\nis reasonably assertive as well.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,010\r\nIn fact, what if both of you have watched this video\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,040\r\nand know about this technique?\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,010\r\nWhat\'s gonna happen then?\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,000\r\nAnd the answer is, it will still be fine.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,030\r\nIt\'s just good communication.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,000\r\nI\'ve got an example here that actually is\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,090\r\nbased on a real friend of mine.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,060\r\nAnd what happened was that his wife said to him,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,020\r\nand she pretty much used the four-step process of,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,030\r\n\"I know that you don\'t like cooking\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,080\r\n\"but I feel a bit neglected when you don\'t cook me food.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,060\r\n\"I would really like it if you cook me an occasional meal.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,060\r\n\"Would you do that for me?\"\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,060\r\nAnd he then could have replied,\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,040\r\n\"Well, I can understand why you\'d like me to cook for you,\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,020\r\n\"but I feel really tired when I get back home from work\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,030\r\n\"and I hate cooking and, all I want\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,090\r\n\"is for you to cook the food.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,010\r\n\"Surely you could do that for me, couldn\'t you?\"\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,060\r\nAnd then she could use the next one and say,\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,090\r\n\"Well, I can understand why you would hate cooking\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,060\r\n\"but I do really feel quite neglected\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,050\r\n\"and all I want is the occasional meal.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,030\r\n\"Surely you could cook for me occasionally?\"\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,000\r\nAnd they could go round and round forever, couldn\'t they?\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,010\r\nBut the point is, by using this process,\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,050\r\nthey\'re both saying how they feel and what they want.\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,000\r\nAnd they\'re both checking with the other person\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,010\r\nand saying, \"Can you see it from my point of view?\"\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,070\r\nAnd hopefully they can work out some sort of\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,020\r\nworking compromise where, maybe he cooks occasionally\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,090\r\nor maybe they eat out once a week\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,030\r\nor have a takeaway or something like that.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,050\r\nSo this technique could save a marriage.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,050\r\nSo, that\'s the four-step process.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,040\r\nI understand, I feel, I want, Is that OK?\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,020\r\nAnd I\'d like you to just think about\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,000\r\nwhich of those four steps you tend to forget.\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080\r\nYou know, maybe you don\'t always say how you feel\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,000\r\nor maybe you\'re not very clear on what you want\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080\r\nor perhaps, you don\'t always finish\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,000\r\nwith that fourth step of saying,\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000\r\n\"Do you think that\'s a reasonable request?\"\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,070\r\nSo you can practice one step at a time\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,020\r\nuntil you get really smooth at using all the four steps.\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,030\r\nBut you could also think of a particularly difficult\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,090\r\nsituation you\'ve got coming up\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,030\r\nand you could actually work out what you\'re gonna say\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,070\r\nfor each of those four steps so that\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,000\r\nyou\'re ready to use it in a real situation.\r\n\r\n"

naturally?\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,090\r\nAnd I think the first reason for this\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,040\r\nis that we are actually animals, really.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,060\r\nWe still are animals,\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,050\r\nand we have fight or flight built into us.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,060\r\nAnd what happens in a stressful situation\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,030\r\nis that chemicals like adrenaline\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,080\r\npump into our bloodstream,\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,020\r\nand the objective of those chemicals\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,040\r\nis to help us run away or put up a stronger fight.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,080\r\nBut running away and fighting harder\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,000\r\nare not really appropriate\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,010\r\nresponses to most work situations.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,050\r\nNow animals only have these two choices: fight or flight.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,000\r\nBut we have third one,\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,030\r\nwhich is to talk calmly about an outcome\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,050\r\nthat can work for both parties.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,000\r\nAnd this is really the essence of assertiveness.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,040\r\nNot being aggressive.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,070\r\nNot being too submissive.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,020\r\nBut calmly working out an acceptable outcome for all.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,030\r\nI\'ll give you an example of how easy it is\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,050\r\nto get into a fight or flight situation,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,090\r\nand also how ineffective it is.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,020\r\nI was going on a cycle ride.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,000\r\nIt was about 20 miles.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040\r\nAnd after the first mile, we went past a house.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,010\r\nAnd this German Shepherd Alsatian dog\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010\r\ncame rushing out barking at me.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,050\r\nIt gave me a real shock, and I quickly cycled away.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,060\r\nAnd I went into flight mode.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,070\r\nThe adrenaline pumped in.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,070\r\nI cycled away.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,010\r\nI was faster than the dog.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,040\r\nAnd I got away.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040\r\nAnd I was thinking about it as I cycled around.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,030\r\nAnd I was thinking,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,030\r\nThat dog, I\'m gonna get him.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,030\r\nBecause I knew that at the end of the ride,\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,080\r\nwe were going to go back past the same house.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040\r\nAnd I spent the whole 20 miles thinking about this dog.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,010\r\nI\'m gonna reach down and I\'m gonna get my bike pump.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,020\r\nI\'m gonna jump off my bike, and I\'m gonna shout at the dog.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,050\r\nAnd as we approached the house, I did just that.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,040\r\nI was reaching down.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,070\r\nI had the bike pump ready.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,000\r\nI was all ready to get him.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,050\r\nAnd of course he didn\'t come out.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,040\r\nHe was asleep or something like that.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,050\r\nAnd I\'d wasted the whole bike ride\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,070\r\nbeing angry, ready for this dog.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,080\r\nAnd I never got closure.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040\r\nEven now, I\'m kind of thinking about it.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nI never got closure.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nI never got a chance to have a go at the dog.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,030\r\nAnd what I should have done was let it go,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,010\r\nbut it\'s hard to do because you\'ve got these chemicals\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,070\r\ngoing through your bloodstream.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,010\r\nSo the moral of this story I think is\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,050\r\nthat with an animal there\'s no other option.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,000\r\nIt\'s either dominate or be dominated.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,040\r\nBut if it was a person,\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,010\r\nthe third option would have been much better.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,000\r\nNow another reason why it\'s not automatic\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,050\r\nto be assertive is our upbringing.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,050\r\nSchool is pretty much a jungle.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,090\r\nIt\'s pretty much a fight or flight jungle.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,000\r\nKids haven\'t learned about assertiveness yet.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,090\r\nThey\'re still animals in this sense.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,060\r\nAnd kids understand this.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,080\r\nI can remember at school there was one of my classmates\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,090\r\nwho was terrified of wasps.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,020\r\nAnd guess what happened?\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,080\r\nEvery time he used to open his desk,\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,010\r\nthere\'d be another wasp in there.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,060\r\nWe were awful to him,\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,030\r\nand it was a jungle there.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,010\r\nAnd so our upbringing, our first experience really\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,080\r\nof socialization\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,000\r\nprobably doesn\'t encourage assertiveness.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,060\r\nAnd the role models that we have at that age.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,030\r\nThey might be our parents who might be great role models,\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,050\r\nbut may not.\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,000\r\nThey might be rock stars.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,090\r\nThey might be people in films.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,090\r\nAction heroes or cartoon princesses.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,030\r\nIt\'s pretty random who our role models are.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,080\r\nAnd often they\'re not very constructive\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,050\r\nwhen it comes to learning to be assertive\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,080\r\nin real life difficult situations.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,090\r\nSo that\'s two reasons already.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,060\r\nThe animal side of us and then our upbringing.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,070\r\nBut there\'s a third reason why assertiveness is difficult.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,070\r\nAnd that\'s that the other two options\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,090\r\nof being aggressive and being too submissive or passive,\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,030\r\nboth have perceived payoffs which are quite tempting.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,030\r\nBut actually are not as good as we hope.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,090\r\nThey\'re only perceived payoffs.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,040\r\nIf you think about the payoff of being aggressive.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000\r\nYou tend to think that if you\'re aggressive\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,060\r\nyou\'re going to bend other people to your will,\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,030\r\nand you\'re going to get what you want.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,080\r\nAnd being aggressive can work sometimes,\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,050\r\nbut all too often it doesn\'t work,\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,040\r\nbecause the other person will fight back\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,070\r\nor they\'ll get revenge later.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,030\r\nYou\'ll make an enemy, and it\'ll cost you more in the end.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,020\r\nAnd so being aggressive is not a good life strategy overall.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,050\r\nWhat about being a submissive?\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,090\r\nWhat about letting other people have their way\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,070\r\nin the hope that they\'re going to like you?\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,020\r\nAnd the perceived payoff is that you\'ll have an easy life\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,090\r\nand you\'ll be liked.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,030\r\nBut of course, instead of saying something at the time,\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,090\r\nyou end up bottling it up.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,080\r\nYou end up not getting what you want,\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,000\r\nand it all it does is add to your stress,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000\r\nand you never get closure.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,010\r\nI\'ll give you a quick example of a time\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,060\r\nwhen I wasn\'t assertive enough.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,050\r\nI used to share an office with a guy called Paul.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,090\r\nAnd he used to irritate me anyway,\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,070\r\n\'cause he used to not answer my phone when I was away.\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,080\r\nHe never left me messages.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,020\r\nI used to leave him messages of people who\'d called.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,010\r\nBut one day he did something which really upset me,\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,050\r\nwas he brought his lunch back to the office,\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,080\r\nand he was eating fried egg and baked beans.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,050\r\nAnd the whole office stank of beans.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,050\r\nAnd I remember thinking if he does it again,\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,010\r\nI\'m going to say something to him about it.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,060\r\nBut I thought I won\'t say something this time.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,020\r\nI\'ll wait and I\'ll see if he does it a second time\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,060\r\nand then I\'ll say something.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,050\r\nBut he never did it again.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,040\r\nAnd the ridiculous thing is\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,050\r\nI\'ve still got that thought in my mind years later\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,090\r\nthat if he does it again I\'ll say something.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,090\r\nBecause I never got closure on it.\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,010\r\nI never needed to.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010\r\nAnd of course what probably have happened\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,060\r\nis if he\'d done it again I would have bottled it up\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040\r\nuntil he\'d done it about five times,\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,020\r\nand then suddenly I would have flipped\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060\r\nfrom being too submissive to being aggressive.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,040\r\nAnd I suddenly would have gone,\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,050\r\nPaul, stop eating those beans!\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,040\r\nAnd then that would have been totally the wrong approach.\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070\r\nHe would\'ve said, \"Well I didn\'t know it was a problem.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,010\r\n\"You never told me.\"\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,080\r\nSo bottling it up and then exploding and swinging\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,010\r\nfrom one end of the scale to the other is not a good plan.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,030\r\nSulking, what can we do about this?\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,090\r\nI suppose the first thing is to realize\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,020\r\nthat we are animals.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,050\r\nWe have to make allowance for the fact\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,060\r\nthat we\'ve got these chemicals that go through our systems.\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,050\r\nAnd then we should use the power of our conscious brains\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,070\r\nto take control of how we react.\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,050\r\nTo think before we act, because we do have control\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,080\r\nover how we act in situations.\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,010\r\nAnd that\'s really what this course is about.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,080\r\nBeing aware of yourself in situations,\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040\r\nand then using the best strategies for those.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,000\r\nSo I\'d like you start thinking about situations\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040\r\nwhere maybe you could\'ve been more assertive.\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,030\r\nMaybe you became a bit more aggressive\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,020\r\nthan you should\'ve been, or maybe where you were too

curtain,\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,030\r\nand just threw it away on the floor and said,\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,080\r\n\"Nurse, there\'s no towels!\"\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,030\r\nAnd that\'s really aggressive.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,040\r\nHis belief is that he\'s the\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:11,040 -->

gets.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,050\r\nIf he needs help from other people they\'re not\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,090\r\ngonna be on his side, it\'s not a good starting point.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,070\r\nThe nurses on the other hand in that situation,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,060\r\nthey were pushed into the bottom left,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,060\r\ninto the \"I\'m not okay\" box.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,070\r\nThey were submissively hiding behind\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,090\r\none of the beds probably,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,040\r\nthinking, \"Oh no, we\'ve probably upset the doctor.\"\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,060\r\nAnd you might think,\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060\r\n\"Not many people are gonna be in the I\'m not okay box.\"\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,070\r\nBut actually it\'s very easy to be in the not okay box.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,060\r\nDo you like the sight of yourself in a mirror?\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,070\r\nDo you like the sound of your voice\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,070\r\non an answer phone message?\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,030\r\nAnd people are often not even okay about\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,030\r\nhow they look or how they sound.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030\r\nLet alone all of the other intricacies of their personality.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,090\r\nThe thing is that the world is trying\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,070\r\nto push us down into this not okay box.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,090\r\nYou look at women\'s magazines, they\'ve got beautiful people,\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,000\r\nairbrushed, looking perfect.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000\r\nAnd there\'s pressure on us\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,060\r\nto look like the women on the cover,\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,090\r\nor the man on the cover of men\'s magazines\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,090\r\nincreasingly as well.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,050\r\nSo it\'s very important to believe that you\'re okay\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,020\r\nand to have, maybe a mantra, which is,\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,010\r\n\"Nobody\'s gonna push me into the not okay box.\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,070\r\n\"I\'m okay as a person.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,020\r\n\"I\'m not perfect, but I\'m good enough,\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,040\r\n\"and the world is not gonna tell me that I\'m not.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,060\r\n\"I\'ll decide whether I\'m okay or not.\"\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,070\r\nNow there is one more box that I haven\'t mentioned:\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,080\r\nThe I\'m not okay and the world is also not okay box.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,090\r\nThis box is unsustainable, you can\'t live in this box.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,060\r\nApparently teenagers quite often start in the bottom left,\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,030\r\nfeeling not okay, maybe they\'re spotty,\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,000\r\nthey can\'t get a girlfriend, everything\'s too difficult.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,010\r\nAnd then as they start to lose respect for their parents\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,050\r\nand discover their parents don\'t know all the answers either\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,090\r\nthey start to move across into that bottom right box.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,000\r\nBut of course the problem is then you\'ve\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080\r\ngot nothing to cling to at all, nothing\'s all right.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,070\r\nThe theory goes that you have to come out\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,040\r\neither by going upwards into the aggressive box of,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040\r\n\"(scoffs) Everybody\'s a fool, they don\'t understand me.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,060\r\n\"They\'ve got no taste in cloths,\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,020\r\n\"they\'ve got no musical taste.\"\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,010\r\nOr they have to go back into the depressed box of,\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,000\r\n\"Oh, I\'m just not good enough.\"\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,030\r\nBut hopefully whichever box they come out into\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,020\r\nthey will eventually find their way up into that\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,010\r\ntop left box of believing that they\'re not too bad, really,\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,000\r\nand the world isn\'t too bad really,\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,060\r\nand they can get on with life.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,000\r\nI\'d like you to just think about yourself,\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,070\r\nwhich is your home box.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,050\r\nDo you tend to be a bit too not okay about yourself,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,090\r\nor do you tend to assume that other people are not okay?\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,030\r\nHopefully you\'re safely in that top left box\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,010\r\nof believing that you\'re okay and that everyone else is.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,020\r\nNow remember: You decide whether you\'re okay.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,000\r\nNobody else can push you into that not okay box.\r\n\r\n"

yet,\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,020\r\nwhich is passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,060\r\nWe\'ve only been looking at passive or submissive,\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,090\r\nthey mean the same thing.\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,010\r\nAnd aggressive, and then assertive as the right way.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,090\r\nBut what about if you didn\'t respect anybody\'s rights?\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,040\r\nNot yours or theirs.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,080\r\nThat would be passive-aggressive,\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,000\r\nand this is really the worst combination.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,060\r\nIt\'s not a halfway point, it\'s a lose-lose situation.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,080\r\nI\'m gonna give you a quick example of this,\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,030\r\na story somebody told me on a training course,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,050\r\nI\'m sure it\'s true.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,020\r\nShe just bought this new car,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020\r\nit\'s quite a cheap make of car.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,040\r\nBut it was new, it\'s the first ever new car she\'d had,\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,060\r\nshe was really proud of it.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,090\r\nShe drove to the super-market in it.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,060\r\nAnd when she got there,\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,070\r\nshe pulled up next to a Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,010\r\nand there was a very posh lady\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,090\r\nwho was driving the Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,050\r\nand when the posh lady got out,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,080\r\nshe just slammed her door into the side of this new car,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,050\r\nand it put a big dent in the side of the car.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,040\r\nThose Rolls-Royce doors are really heavy.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,090\r\nThe Rolls-Royce lady didn\'t even notice,\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,070\r\nshe just banged into the car, got out,\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,090\r\nand she just walked her way to the super-market.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,060\r\nMeanwhile, the lady who\'d turned up\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,030\r\nin her pride and joy new car,\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,060\r\nwent running around to the side,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,070\r\nhad a look and saw the dent.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,010\r\nNow, what would you do if that happened to you?\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,080\r\nReally, you\'ve got various options.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,020\r\nYou could be passive and just think,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,080\r\n\"Ugh, typical of my luck.\"\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,020\r\nYou could be aggressive and go and shout at the woman,\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,050\r\n\"You\'ve ruined my car!\"\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,050\r\nOf course, the best option is to be assertive\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,080\r\nand to go running after the lady and say,\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,050\r\n\"Excuse me, you probably didn\'t notice,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,020\r\n\"you\'ve just dented my car,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,030\r\n\"would you be able to pay for it?\"\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,090\r\nShe\'d probably be fine about paying for it,\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,080\r\nso it\'d probably be fine.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,050\r\nBut the worst option, the fourth one,\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,000\r\nis to be passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,090\r\nAnd this is what the lady actually did.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,050\r\nShe got out her keys of her brand new car\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,030\r\nand she went up and down the side of the Rolls-Royce,\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,020\r\ngreat big scratch down the Rolls-Royce.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,040\r\nIf you think about it, that\'s just lose-lose,\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,090\r\nit doesn\'t help anybody.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nBecause her new car still got a dent,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,000\r\nnow the Rolls-Royce is scratched as well.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,030\r\nShe\'s being aggressive, not against the woman,\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,080\r\nbut against her car,\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,010\r\nand that doesn\'t solve anything.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,060\r\nShe\'s gonna come back to her car and think,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,050\r\n\"Ugh, look what someone\'s done.\"\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,080\r\nShe\'s not even gonna know why.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080\r\nPassive-aggressive is quite a tempting option,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,050\r\nbecause the chemicals are in our blood,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,090\r\nwe feel aggressive,\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,050\r\nbut we\'re not actually assertive enough to actually\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,020\r\nconfront the person, so we take it out against the car.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,000\r\nA common work example of passive-aggressive\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000\r\nwould be criticizing people behind their back.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080\r\nYou\'re being aggressive about the person,\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,060\r\nbut you\'re being passive in terms of,\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,010\r\nyou\'re not actually confronting them.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,000\r\nSo, you might find it interesting just to think about,\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,020\r\nhave you been passive-aggressive at all recently?\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,000\r\nIs it a tendency that you have?\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,060\r\nAnd what would the assertive option look like?\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060\r\nWhat would it look and feel like to calmly\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,000\r\nconfront the person and tell them about\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000\r\nhow you feel, and what you would like to happen.\r\n\r\n"

inherited,\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,010\r\nbut I think you\'ll agree\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,070\r\nthat things like a short temper or shyness\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,040\r\nare learned behaviors\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,030\r\nrather than inherited, unchangeable traits.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,080\r\nMost of your personality consists of learned habits\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,020\r\nthat you\'ve built up during your life so far.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,090\r\nAnd these are known as life scripts.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,070\r\nExamples of life scripts could be:\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,000\r\nI\'m impatient.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,020\r\nI\'m shy.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,000\r\nI hate giving talks.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040\r\nI always think of the best thing to say afterwards\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,020\r\nwhen it\'s too late.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,080\r\nThose are typical life scripts.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,070\r\nYou can have good scripts too.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,060\r\nLike I\'m good under pressure.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,000\r\nI love giving talks.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000\r\nI like meeting new people.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,060\r\nAny statement that starts with,\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,000\r\n\"I can\'t help,\" or \"I always seem to,\"\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,090\r\nor \"I\'m hopeless at,\" or \"I\'m great at,\"\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,020\r\nthese are all scripts.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,060\r\nAnd they can be changed.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,020\r\nScripts get stronger with time,\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,030\r\nbecause beliefs lead to thoughts and behaviors,\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,000\r\nwhich then lead to events happening.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,020\r\nAnd these strengthen your beliefs.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,030\r\nI know I\'m impatient.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,070\r\nI\'ve got 50 years of evidence of myself\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,090\r\nstamping my feet in cues.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,060\r\nAnd my belief about myself leads to my behavior,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,070\r\nwhich gives me more and more evidence that that\'s how I am.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,000\r\nSo to change yourself means\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,030\r\nchanging at the very least your behaviors,\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,020\r\nbut ideally your underlying thoughts and beliefs\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,060\r\nabout yourself too.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,080\r\nBut can this be done?\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,040\r\nAnd the answer is yes.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000\r\nAnd you can do it by changing your self talk.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,010\r\nThe words that you say in your head.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,020\r\nYour subconscious is listening to everything\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020\r\nthat you say to yourself.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,030\r\nBy the way, do you have a voice in your head?\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,040\r\nOne voice in your head is good.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,070\r\nHopefully you haven\'t got two voices\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,070\r\nthat are arguing with each other.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,040\r\nSo most people have one talking voice,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nand this talking voice is your conscious mind.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nAnd the silent listener that\'s also in your head\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,050\r\nis your subconscious, which then acts\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,090\r\non whatever you tell it.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,060\r\nIt\'s quite a scary thought.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,070\r\nSo if you say, \"When I give this presentation\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,070\r\n\"it\'s going to go horribly wrong,\"\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,010\r\nyour subconscious listens to that, it acts on that,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,070\r\nand it then makes the talk go horribly wrong.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,090\r\nSo if you can change your self talk\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,000\r\nto only positive statements,\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,060\r\nyour subconscious will hear these,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,090\r\nand gradually it will come to believe you,\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,030\r\nuntil the new state has become true.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,080\r\nSo if you say, \"I love giving talks.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080\r\n\"I\'m looking forward to the big\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,050\r\n\"conference that\'s coming up,\"\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,040\r\nat first it will feel very weird.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,050\r\nYou\'ll feel something called cognitive dissonance,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,000\r\nwhich is where you consciously say,\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,020\r\n\"I\'m looking forward to the talk,\"\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,080\r\nand your subconscious says, \"What?\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,090\r\n\"He\'s never said this before.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,020\r\n\"This can\'t be true.\"\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,030\r\nBut after awhile, you start to accept it.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030\r\nYour subconscious starts to think that...\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,090\r\nThat something\'s changed somewhere,\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,040\r\nand maybe you are actually looking forward\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,090\r\nto giving the talk.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,050\r\nAnd the battleship of 50 years of experience and evidence\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,090\r\nis starting to be slowly turned.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,050\r\nAnd you just keep pushing and pushing\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,060\r\na little bit every day.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060\r\nPositive statements every day.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,000\r\nAnd you can change anything\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000\r\nyou want to change about yourself.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,020\r\nAnd it only takes about a month.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020\r\nWhich is amazing, isn\'t it?\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060\r\nSo, what\'s your pet negative script\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060\r\nthat you\'d like to change?\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,080\r\nWhat aspect of your personality and behavior\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040\r\nwould you like to change?\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:19,040 -->

of your negative emotions?\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,010\r\nGet rid of worry, fear, anger, hate,\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,080\r\njealousy, regret, blame,

you keep a couple of your\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,020\r\nfavorite ones if you\'d like.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,000\r\nAlthough really, why would you?\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040\r\nTo get rid of any negative emotion,\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,050\r\nthe first step is taking responsibility.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,050\r\nRealizing that you are responsible for\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090\r\nmost situations that you find yourself in,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,010\r\nand you are always responsible for\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,000\r\nhow you handle that situation.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040\r\nOften, the things that make us most angry\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,070\r\nare things that we know are our fault, really.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,020\r\nWe\'ll take another negative emotion, worry.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,070\r\nOnce we realize that we need to take responsibility\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,040\r\nfor the outcome rather than just worrying about it,\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,040\r\nwe can start to plan and work on getting it right,\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,000\r\nand the worry is reduced.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,060\r\nI think it\'s amazing that responsibility is involved in\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,050\r\npretty much every negative emotion, when you think about it.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,090\r\nJealousy, blame, regret, guilt.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,080\r\nBut the more I think about it,\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040\r\nthe more convinced I am that this is true.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,060\r\nI suppose you could say that you\'re responsible\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,000\r\neven for whether you choose that negative emotion at all.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,090\r\nAre you aware that you are choosing negative emotions?\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,030\r\nIt may feel that they automatically\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,030\r\nspring up from within you.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,030\r\nBut think about it,\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,080\r\nmaybe you\'re responsible for choosing them.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,050\r\nDid you choose to get angry?\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,080\r\nOr, to put it another way,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,090\r\ncould you choose to not get angry?\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,010\r\nI think you could.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,030\r\nSo, why would someone choose\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,000\r\na negative emotion like anger or guilt?\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000\r\nWell, we\'re choosing them due to false payoffs.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,040\r\nWe believe we\'re gonna get a payoff,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,050\r\nwhich we actually don\'t really get.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,080\r\nLet\'s look at both anger and guilt\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,090\r\nand look at the false payoffs.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,000\r\nWhat would be the payoff that you\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000\r\nmight get from becoming angry?\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,030\r\nWell, I think there are two payoffs\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,010\r\nwe think we\'re gonna get.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,080\r\nOne is that it will make us stronger.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000\r\nBut actually, does it make you stronger if you get angry?\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000\r\nAre you most likely to get\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000\r\nwhat you want by getting angry?\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,020\r\nAnd I would say, probably not.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,010\r\nThe other payoff is a feeling\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,060\r\nthat we might be able to let off steam\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,090\r\nand feel better afterwards.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,020\r\nBut actually, do you feel better\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,010\r\nafter you\'ve got angry?\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,080\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,050\r\nOnce you realize that actually,\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,010\r\nanger doesn\'t make you stronger,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,090\r\nand it doesn\'t give you a feeling\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,060\r\nof letting off steam and feeling better afterwards,\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,090\r\nyou can then decide to not choose anger.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,040\r\nMoving on to guilt, the second one,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080\r\nwhat are the payoffs we might think\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,020\r\nthat we\'re gonna get from guilt?\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,000\r\nI think, again, there are two main ones.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,090\r\nOne is that maybe feeling guilty\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,040\r\nabout something you\'ve done makes you feel\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,010\r\nthat you\'re an okay person, really.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,080\r\nEven though you did a bad thing,\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,030\r\nat least you\'re a good person.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,040\r\nBut on the other hand,\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,030\r\ndoes guilt make you an okay person\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,020\r\nafter you\'ve done a bad thing?\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,030\r\nAnd I would say, \"No, it doesn\'t.\"\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,040\r\nYou did the bad thing.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,090\r\nThe other payoff that you might think you get from guilt,\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,090\r\nis that it makes less likely to do the bad thing again.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,020\r\nBut again, do you get that payoff?\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,070\r\nAnd I would say, probably not.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,030\r\nI think guilt almost gives you permission\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,090\r\nto keep doing the bad thing,\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,020\r\nat least you feel guilty every time you do it.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,020\r\nSo, I think guilt is actually gonna make you\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,060\r\nmore likely to keep doing that bad thing.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,040\r\nOnce you realize that you\'re choosing these emotions,\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000\r\nand that the payoffs that you think you\'re\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,050\r\ngonna get are actually false,\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,060\r\nyou can then begin to choose to not have them.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,010\r\nWhat would a life of no guilt be like?\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,080\r\nWould it possible to get rid of guilt?\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,010\r\nWhen you start thinking about this,\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,040\r\nthere are two main ways that you could\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,020\r\nlive a life free from guilt.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020\r\nOne would be, to be a complete angel.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020\r\nTo be perfect, never do a bad thing.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,040\r\nI think that would be impossible,\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040\r\nAt least it would for me.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,050\r\nThe other option would be to be a complete devil.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,040\r\nDo bad things all the time, and not care.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,020\r\nI think we all agree,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,040\r\nthat would be an unacceptable option.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,030\r\nBut of course, what about a mixture of these two things.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,070\r\nIf you could be a mixture of the angel option\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,000\r\nand the devil option,\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,020\r\nthat would be possible to do, that would work.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,080\r\nFor example, when my neighbor\'s cat comes\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,090\r\nthrough into my garden, trying to eat my goldfish\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,040\r\nthat I\'ve got in my pond,\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,060\r\nI could squirt the cat with my garden hose.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020\r\nBut if I did, I\'d feel bad about that,\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,040\r\nI\'d feel guilty about that.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080\r\nSo, I\'m gonna choose the angel option for that,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,050\r\nand I\'m gonna not do it.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,000\r\nWhen it comes to eating a second doughnut,\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,060\r\nI think I\'m gonna go for the devil option\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,040\r\nand just do that.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040\r\nIf I have a mixture of the angel choice\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,020\r\nand the devil choice in my life,\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,010\r\nI can live a life free from guilt.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,080\r\nThe answer to get rid of guilt is actually\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,090\r\nto change what you do, which is the angel option.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,050\r\nOr, change what you say to yourself,\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,050\r\nwhich is the devil option,\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,070\r\nand banish guilt forever.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,040\r\nIt\'s the same for all other negative emotions.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,080\r\nI want you to think about, what\'s your pet one?\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,090\r\nWhat\'s the payoff that you think you\'re getting from it?\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,070\r\nAnd is that payoff forced?\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,000\r\nWhich, of course, it is.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000\r\nAnd then, decide not to have that\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000\r\nnegative emotion in your life anymore.\r\n\r\n"

put-downs.\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,010\r\nWhen someone puts you down verbally,\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,010\r\nit\'s really a form of aggression.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,050\r\nMost aggression these days is actually\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050\r\nnot physical, it\'s verbal.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,040\r\nAnd as we\'ve seen,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,090\r\nthe temptation is to be aggressive back,\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,080\r\nor to be submissive and let them get away with it.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,020\r\nBut to confront them assertively would be the best option.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,000\r\nThe one that\'s most likely to give you a successful outcome.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\r\nSome examples of common put-downs at work\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,020\r\nwould be things like,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,030\r\nstereotyping you, patronizing you,\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,010\r\ninterfering with your work,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,020\r\nignoring things that you\'ve said,\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,070\r\nimplying that you have a fault\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,090\r\nor are under-performing,\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,090\r\nwithout actually coming out and saying it.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,000\r\nAnd using emotive words like \"stupid\",\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000\r\nor \"useless\", or \"that was a crazy decision\".\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,050\r\nThese are all types of everyday put-downs.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,010\r\nThe approach to take with these types\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nof verbal aggression is, number one,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,000\r\nto realize that it is aggression.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080\r\nNumber two, to realize that they may not\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,040\r\nbe a bad person, maybe they don\'t realize\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,020\r\nthat they have an effectively\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,070\r\nanti-social habit, like interrupting.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,030\r\nOr maybe they\'re having a bad day.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,000\r\nBut then number three, to decide that you\'re not\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,090\r\ngoing to be submissive and taken.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,000\r\nBut you\'re also not going to bite back aggressively.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080\r\nNumber four, then, is to remain calm,\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,050\r\nand speak calmly to them.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,090\r\nEven if you decide to tell someone\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,060\r\nthat you\'re very upset by what they\'ve just said,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,050\r\ndo it calmly.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,060\r\nNumber five is to tell them how you feel,\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000\r\nand what you would like them to do differently next time.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,090\r\nI\'ll cover the exact words for how to do this\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,080\r\nin a later video on this course.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,030\r\nIt feels good to remain calm,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,020\r\nand it feels good to be nice.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,000\r\nDo you find that?\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,070\r\nBeing nice to someone horrible\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,040\r\ngives you a great feeling of control,\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,010\r\nand they usually apologize to you later.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,070\r\nSo, I\'d like you to ask yourself\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,060\r\nwhat types of put-down you sometimes,\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,080\r\nor often experience at work.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,090\r\nAnd then plan your answer.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,020\r\nImagine yourself calmly telling them that,\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,090\r\nfor example, you don\'t like being interrupted,\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,010\r\nand you\'d like to just finish your statement.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,070\r\nOr maybe, when they say,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,050\r\n\"That\'s typical of a technician!\"\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,020\r\nThat you\'d like to be given the chance to show\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,030\r\nthat your plan is a good one.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,080\r\nPlan how you\'re going to tell them how you feel,\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,040\r\nand what you want them to do differently in future,\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000\r\nwhen they deal with you.\r\n\r\n"

response,\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,020\r\nthere\'s a tiny moment when you can decide\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,050\r\nhow you will react.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,000\r\nYou\'ve already seen how you can do this\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,030\r\nwith negative emotions and choose not to have them.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,050\r\nBut you can also take control of what you say and do,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,060\r\nwhen dealing with someone aggressive.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,000\r\nFirst, ask yourself if it\'s their problem or yours.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,020\r\nMaybe what they\'re doing is fine,\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,040\r\nand it\'s you that has the problem with it.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,010\r\nFor example, people playing music next door.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,010\r\nMaybe it\'s not that late in the evening,\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,060\r\nand they\'re entitled to some fun.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,000\r\nDoes it matter that much?\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,010\r\nThe person who\'s irritating you immensely\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,060\r\nin the meeting by checking his messages on his phone.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,010\r\nIs it affecting you?\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,030\r\nIs it such a big deal?\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,020\r\nIs it a battle worth fighting?\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,060\r\nMaybe the problem\'s in your head.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,000\r\nThis is the first detachment question.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nIs it worth getting involved?\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,050\r\nOne more example of this,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,060\r\nmy next-door neighbor used to drop in,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,040\r\nand he would criticize aspects of my house.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,090\r\nHe would say,\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,070\r\n\"Oh, I see you\'ve got your new windows, Chris.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,060\r\n\"What did you go for?\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,090\r\n\"Oh, you went for the plastic ones.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,090\r\n\"I wouldn\'t have done that,\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,020\r\n\"but still, it\'s up to you.\"\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,090\r\nIt used to be really annoying.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,000\r\nBut then, his behavior was his problem, not mine.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,020\r\nSo, maybe it was best just to be detached\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,070\r\nand just quietly laugh at it rather than getting annoyed.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,010\r\nThe second detachment question is,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,060\r\n\"What\'s my objective in this situation,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,050\r\n\"and what\'s the best way to get it?\"\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,060\r\nOnce you know what you want to achieve,\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,020\r\nyou can calmly act without emotion\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,010\r\nin order to get it.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,000\r\nI play in a band in my spare time,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,060\r\nand we have a bass player of questionable abilities,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,030\r\nand the guitarist is always criticizing him\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,030\r\nbehind his back.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,020\r\n\"Did you hear what he played on that last song?\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,090\r\n\"It was rubbish!\"\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,040\r\nAnd my question is always,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,060\r\n\"What do you want to do about it?\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,010\r\n\"Do you think we should tell him?\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,010\r\n\"Should we get him to write the chords down?\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,000\r\n\"Would you want to replace him?\"\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,020\r\nThe guitar player never has an answer to this.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,030\r\nHe would rather waste time complaining\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,060\r\nthan have a clear objective,\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,060\r\nand then calmly put it into practice.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,020\r\nSo, are you detached enough?\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,020\r\nDo you take on things that are not worth the effort,\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,030\r\nor are never going to succeed?\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,050\r\nWhat can you detach from and just let it go?\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,070\r\nIn the situations that you are determined to change,\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,030\r\ndo you have clear objectives\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,000\r\nthat are feasible for you to achieve?\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,070\r\nAre there situations about which you are unhappy,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,090\r\nbut where you don\'t yet have a plan\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,020\r\nfor what you are going to do?\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,000\r\nTake a moment from this course to think\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000\r\nabout these important questions.\r\n\r\n"

Am I right?\"\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,060\r\nNow this could be done during the meeting\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060\r\nor it could be done one-to-one afterwards.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,040\r\nYou can pick them up and say,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,050\r\n\"During the meeting I just had a feeling each time\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,090\r\n\'I said this, I noticed this\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,090\r\n\'and I just interpret it as this; am I right?\"\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,000\r\nIt\'s non-aggressive.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,010\r\nIt\'s just clarifying.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,060\r\nWhat are they going to do when you say this?\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,050\r\nWell, they\'ve really only got two options.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,060\r\nThey can either say, \"No sorry,\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,030\r\n\'I didn\'t mean anything by it.\"\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,000\r\nSome people just have unfortunate body language.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,010\r\nBut the other thing is, they may say, \"Well yeah, actually\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,020\r\n\'I do think that the production department are not\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,050\r\n\'doing their job properly; been late on the last three jobs\"\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,050\r\nor whatever, \"And this is what I want\".\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,080\r\nSo we can have a decent conversation about what\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,060\r\nthe problem is.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,020\r\nWe flushed it out.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,050\r\nSo what we\'re doing here is we\'re clarifying\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,060\r\nwith this little technique.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000\r\nSo have you had any recent examples\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,090\r\nwhen you could have used this?\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,040\r\nWere there some situations that came up in meetings\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,010\r\nor just to one-to-one perhaps\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,060\r\nwhere the person\'s body language\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,040\r\nwas a little bit aggressive?\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,020\r\nOr, are there any people who tend to use subtly aggressive\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,040\r\nbody language that you can try this out on?\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,020\r\nI\'d like you just to think about that.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,000\r\nHow could you apply this technique?\r\n\r\n"

other person.\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,040\r\nMaybe the words that they\'re using\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000\r\nor the emotions that they\'re having.\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,020\r\nSo in terms of the words, if they describe a decision\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,030\r\nas stupid or crazy\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,000\r\nyou could pick them up on those words and say,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\r\n\"Well I agree that the decision in retrospect\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040\r\n\"could have been better but I think it\'s a bit harsh\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,020\r\n\"to call it crazy.\"\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,010\r\nAnd then if necessary you could point out\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,090\r\ntheir behavior and emotional state as well.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,090\r\nFor example if somebody\'s shouting at you\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,050\r\nyou can say to them,\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,020\r\n\"You\'re shouting at me and disturbing everyone\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,060\r\n\"else in the office.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,040\r\n\"Is this the best way to resolve this problem?\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,070\r\n\"Maybe we could meet later when\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,050\r\n\"you\'re in a calmer mood.\"\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,000\r\nSo you calmly point out their behavior and their emotions\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000\r\nand this works because often people aren\'t\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,060\r\nconscious of their behavior.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,090\r\nThey\'ve slipped into autopilot.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,020\r\nAnd the hope is that they\'ll say,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,010\r\n\"Oh yeah, sorry about that.\"\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,020\r\nIf they say,\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,010\r\n\"I\'ll damn well shout if I want to!\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,050\r\n\"I\'m really annoyed!\"\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,030\r\nthen you now know what you\'re dealing with\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,070\r\nand you\'re fully justified in saying\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,050\r\n\"Well I\'m not going to try to resolve this\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,040\r\n\"when you\'re in that state, we\'ll talk in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,000\r\nPointing out their behavior can also be used\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,090\r\nto show that you\'re on to their game.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,020\r\nFor example a perennial problem I get\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,070\r\nis trying to get a gig in a pub\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,000\r\nand trying to get a meeting with the landlord\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,010\r\nand there\'s always somebody saying,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000\r\n\"Oh he\'s not here I\'m afraid.\"\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040\r\nI suspect he probably is there upstairs\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,020\r\nand just isn\'t talking to visitors.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,010\r\nSo the thing is to comment on the process\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,000\r\nand say to them,\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040\r\n\"Well I\'ve been in several times now\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,050\r\n\"and these random visits just aren\'t working\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,070\r\n\"so can you help me and maybe suggest\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,080\r\n\"a better way to contact him?\"\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,030\r\nSo by highlighting the process you\'re saying\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,040\r\n\"I\'m on to your game, it can\'t go on,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,060\r\n\"we need to find another way.\"\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,090\r\nAsking them for help is quite powerful too.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,060\r\nSo maybe there are people in your work\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,050\r\nor your personal life who would benefit\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,040\r\nfrom having their aggressive words pointed out\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,060\r\nor their unhelpful behaviors calmly highlighted.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,050\r\nCan you think of some recent situations\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,060\r\nwhere you could\'ve done this?\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,040\r\nSo that you can be ready for them\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,000\r\nwhen it next happens.\r\n\r\n"

someone something\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,010\r\nthat they\'re not going to like hearing?\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,040\r\nAnd this could be anything from,\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,010\r\ntelling your boss that you want a raise,\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,000\r\ntelling somebody that the noise of their music\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080\r\nthrough the wall is keeping you awake,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,090\r\nwanting to tell somebody that their meeting is badly run,\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,010\r\nit could be anything, at home or at work.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,090\r\nWouldn\'t it be amazing if there was a magic\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,020\r\nfour-step process that you could use\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,000\r\nthat would work in any situation.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,090\r\nAnd there is, and I\'m gonna go through it with you now.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,050\r\nNow this four-step process isn\'t actually\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,070\r\nguaranteed to work in any situation.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,000\r\nThis isn\'t gonna work if the person has no vested interest\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040\r\nin a good working relationship with you.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,080\r\nBut of course, in most home and work situations,\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,050\r\nthe other person does have a vested interest\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,090\r\nin keeping the relationship going, in which case,\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,040\r\nthis four-step process is absolutely the best thing to use.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,090\r\nThe four-step process has the basic outline of\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,030\r\nI understand, I feel, I want, Is that OK?\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,000\r\nSo it consists of, first of all,\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,020\r\nunderstanding their position and showing that\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,000\r\nyou understand their position.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,050\r\nSecondly, explaining to them clearly how you feel.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,060\r\nAnd we\'ve already said you\'re gonna do this\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,040\r\ncalmly and quietly, saying how you feel.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,010\r\nNot using facts and logic, but feelings.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,020\r\nThe third bit is to say what you want from the situation,\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,050\r\nand a bit of planning beforehand might be required\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,010\r\nto decide what it is that you want.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,070\r\nAnd then the fourth one is to say, \"Is that OK?\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,090\r\n\"Is that a reasonable request do you think?\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,020\r\n\"Could you do that for me?\"\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,020\r\nI\'ll give you an example of this and then I\'ll explain\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,070\r\nwhy this process is so important.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,090\r\nSuppose somebody\'s interrupting you\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,030\r\nwhen you\'re busy at work.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,060\r\nYou could just say, \"Go away I\'m busy,\"\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,000\r\nbut that\'s quite aggressive.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,060\r\nA nice assertive answer would be to use my\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,040\r\nfour-step process and you\'d say,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,050\r\n\"I understand how urgent this is and see why you want it,\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,000\r\n\"but I just feel a bit under pressure at the moment\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,060\r\n\"with this work I\'m doing here.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060\r\n\"I\'m doing this report.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,030\r\n\"I need to get it done by lunch time.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,020\r\n\"Maybe we could talk this afternoon.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,030\r\n\"Would that be OK?\"\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,020\r\nSo you just follow the four-step process.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,060\r\nIt tells you what to say.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,070\r\nNow, why these four steps in the order they are?\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,000\r\nAnd the reason is that steps two and three\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000\r\nare the slightly aggressive ones.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,010\r\nThe feel and the want steps of,\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,070\r\nyou know, \"I don\'t wanna talk to you now.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,080\r\n\"Can we do it later?\"\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,070\r\nis quite aggressive if you waded straight into that.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,070\r\nBut they\'ve got this fluffy exterior of steps one and four.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,010\r\nSo you say, \"I do understand, but,\"\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,000\r\nI feel like this, I want this.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080\r\n\"Is that OK?\"\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,070\r\nSo, it\'s nice the way that two and three\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,020\r\nhave got steps one and four outside them.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,000\r\nThat\'s why they\'re in that order.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000\r\nAnd all four of them must be done.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060\r\nIf you miss one of them out,\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,080\r\nit won\'t be anything like as effective.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,050\r\nNow, after you\'ve done step four,\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,000\r\nthere are two things that they might say.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,060\r\nThey may yes or they may say no.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,070\r\nNow what if they say yes and then they don\'t do it?\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,020\r\nThey go, \"Yep, we\'re really sorry.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,070\r\n\"We\'ll turn the music down.\"\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,040\r\nAnd then they don\'t.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,080\r\nWell, that\'s relatively straightforward because now\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,030\r\nyou can get them on not keeping their promise.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,090\r\nYou can go back and say, \"Do you remember we had\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,050\r\n\"that little conversation ten minutes ago\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,090\r\n\"and you said you\'d turn the music down?\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,020\r\n\"And you haven\'t.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,060\r\n\"Would it be possible to do that for me please?\"\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,040\r\nSo once you\'ve got a yes out of them, it\'s fairly easy\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,070\r\nto go back and say you haven\'t done what you said you\'d do.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,090\r\nBut what if they say, \"No, I\'m just not prepared to do that.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,010\r\n\"It\'s my party, I\'m having music, get stuffed.\"\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,050\r\nWhat can you do then?\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,080\r\nAnd what I\'d recommend if they say no is,\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,010\r\ngo back around again.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,030\r\nAnd you can say, \"Well, I do understand it\'s your party.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,060\r\n\"It\'s great that you\'re doing that, but I really am\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,080\r\n\"upset about the noise and all I want\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,060\r\n\"is for you to turn it down a little bit.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,020\r\n\"Surely you could do that for me.\"\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,040\r\nSo you go back around and you just jack up the words\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,060\r\na little bit with, \"I really feel strongly,\"\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,020\r\nand \"All I want\".\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,030\r\nAnd if you go back around a second time,\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,070\r\nit\'s gonna be a pretty good chance that it\'s gonna work.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,060\r\nNow, I just want to finally stress with this that\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,030\r\nthis is not designed to batter the person into submission.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,000\r\nWe might be looking for some sort of working compromise\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,020\r\nthat both parties can be happy with.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,090\r\nBecause, as we\'ve said earlier on this course,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,020\r\nit\'s all about rights.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,030\r\nYou\'ve got rights but so have they.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,000\r\nAnd sometimes what you\'ll find is the other person\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070\r\nis reasonably assertive as well.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,010\r\nIn fact, what if both of you have watched this video\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,040\r\nand know about this technique?\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,010\r\nWhat\'s gonna happen then?\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,000\r\nAnd the answer is, it will still be fine.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,030\r\nIt\'s just good communication.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,000\r\nI\'ve got an example here that actually is\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,090\r\nbased on a real friend of mine.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,060\r\nAnd what happened was that his wife said to him,\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,020\r\nand she pretty much used the four-step process of,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,030\r\n\"I know that you don\'t like cooking\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,080\r\n\"but I feel a bit neglected when you don\'t cook me food.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,060\r\n\"I would really like it if you cook me an occasional meal.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,060\r\n\"Would you do that for me?\"\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,060\r\nAnd he then could have replied,\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,040\r\n\"Well, I can understand why you\'d like me to cook for you,\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,020\r\n\"but I feel really tired when I get back home from work\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,030\r\n\"and I hate cooking and, all I want\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,090\r\n\"is for you to cook the food.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,010\r\n\"Surely you could do that for me, couldn\'t you?\"\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,060\r\nAnd then she could use the next one and say,\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,090\r\n\"Well, I can understand why you would hate cooking\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,060\r\n\"but I do really feel quite neglected\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,050\r\n\"and all I want is the occasional meal.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,030\r\n\"Surely you could cook for me occasionally?\"\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,000\r\nAnd they could go round and round forever, couldn\'t they?\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,010\r\nBut the point is, by using this process,\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,050\r\nthey\'re both saying how they feel and what they want.\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,000\r\nAnd they\'re both checking with the other person\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,010\r\nand saying, \"Can you see it from my point of view?\"\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,070\r\nAnd hopefully they can work out some sort of\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,020\r\nworking compromise where, maybe he cooks occasionally\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,090\r\nor maybe they eat out once a week\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,030\r\nor have a takeaway or something like that.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,050\r\nSo this technique could save a marriage.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,050\r\nSo, that\'s the four-step process.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,040\r\nI understand, I feel, I want, Is that OK?\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,020\r\nAnd I\'d like you to just think about\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,000\r\nwhich of those four steps you tend to forget.\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080\r\nYou know, maybe you don\'t always say how you feel\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,000\r\nor maybe you\'re not very clear on what you want\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080\r\nor perhaps, you don\'t always finish\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,000\r\nwith that fourth step of saying,\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000\r\n\"Do you think that\'s a reasonable request?\"\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,070\r\nSo you can practice one step at a time\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,020\r\nuntil you get really smooth at using all the four steps.\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,030\r\nBut you could also think of a particularly difficult\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,090\r\nsituation you\'ve got coming up\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,030\r\nand you could actually work out what you\'re gonna say\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,070\r\nfor each of those four steps so that\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,000\r\nyou\'re ready to use it in a real situation.\r\n\r\n"
